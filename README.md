This is for the Peer Assessment Project for the Cousera's Getting and Cleaning Data. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. The data for this project is obtained at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The zipped file folder includes many files and subfolders. The data are stored in separate files. The goal of this project is to create a tidy table by merging the data, extracting the desired features, and assigning the columns meaning names. The requirements of the project include: 1) A tidy dataset, 2) A script to perform the analysis, 3) CodeBook.md, and 4) README.md. 

### This repository includes:  
1) tidy_data.txt: the created tidy dataset.  
2) Run_Analysis.R: the R script that performs all the data processing and analysis.   
3) CodeBook.md: the md file that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that are performed to clean up the data.  
4) README.md: this file, which explains all the files in this repository.
